   “小心!” My mom darts out to grab my arm as I skim the curb of the sidewalk. A truck roars past.

   “I wasn’t going to walk, you know.” The light turns green. Shenzhen's streets are littered with crumpled newspapers, fast food wrappers, and cigarette butts. Just as quickly as they are discarded, these articles of pedestrian life are flattened by jelly slippers, Nike sneakers, polished loafers, and motorbikes rattling on and off the sidewalks, swerving wildly to avoid even wilder taxi drivers and trucks.

   It's a late July Sunday when the family agreed we could all do with some time from the cloying congestion of the city. The bay beckoned. 

   My mother’s vice grip on my forearm loosens only when we descend the subway entrance and enter the white-tiled underground, which, unlike the city above, is spotless. Two uniformed men stand guard and watch us place our bags on the baggage scanner. They give the picnic basket a cursory glance but spend longer inspecting Dad’s work briefcase. Then, they wave us through the security check and further into the station. Dad produces four subway tokens that send us past the turnstiles and to the main train platform. Men and women in crisp work clothes part briskly around us, eyes glazed.

   “孩子们, do you know how to read the subway map?” Dad’s voice booms as he points to an overhead sign in the train car. Eyes flick off their phones and onto us. 

   “当然知道,” I say, in my best Mandarin. Dad reads each station name to us anyway. 

   An hour’s train ride whisks us from city grays to bay colors untranscribable. The subway entrance at Qianhai Bay is the only modern, machine-made construction here. Its straight and sharp-edged glass and metal jut out haggardly and offbeat. It's an abrupt departure from our feral surroundings. Winking wildflowers and dirt paths grow where they want to, unkempt, untamed, unyielding. Back in Shenzhen, metal-toned skyscrapers are cropping up as I write and you read. Another building is assembled as quickly as Jenga blocks can come tumbling down. Back in Shenzhen, you may know a street today, but tomorrow a slew of stores and shopping centers will make grand openings, new people and new technologies will flood in, and the city will have outpaced you again.

   People laugh and shout freely, here in Qianhai Bay, faces lit and lacking stern shadows. My mother, who said on the train she would do no more than 散步 on the nature trails, rushes for the seawater, even though she had a bad fall once doing the same. Later I watch her sift the sand with bare feet, sandals dangling in hand. The crabs beckon for my brother to trap them. This is what he says, anyway. I wander off to explore the footpaths embedded with massaging stones. Dad smiles warmly and takes a business call. 

   Fishermen’s boats float close to shore, children dance back and forth across the docks, and women stroll in twos and threes between throes of trees. Later, Dad tells me that the only homes the families of the bay know are their shabby boats. I feel a pang of pity fused with envy.

   Down a path shaded by trees and beach umbrellas, a man and boy compete for loose change in the pockets of passersby. The old man’s truck is parked parallel to the sidewalk, fully loaded with a hill of coconuts. Slowly and methodically, his knife hacks slabs of shell onto the road. A boy, younger than my brother nine, stations a wheelbarrow under a tree. A crowd gathers to watch him wield his power drill. His line is longer, but the old man’s truck is close enough to benefit from the attention. Families sip leisurely on their drinks in the shade of trees. When their coconuts are drained, they line up again. The vendors sever the fruit tops, fashioning spoons from shell. We drift off, scooping meat to mouth, smiling, sunburnt, satisfied.

  When we return to the city, my brother and I chuck supermarket coconuts onto the paved sidewalk. When the skulls crack and milk spills down the sides, we peel back the plastic wrap and dig in. Dad catches on quickly after coming home to coconut husks and plastic littered across the pavement, Mom tries to switch us over to Vita Coco, and, just like that, with the taste of wind and salt and coconut still on our tongues, we settle back into life in the city.

<ins> the wilhelm scream</ins>

   In West Berlin’s Charlottenburg, people chase the ephemeral. Charlottenburg is three and four-dollar-sign restaurants, luxury jewelry stores and bridal boutiques, and new, mostly uninhabited apartments furnished with Scandinavian style dining tables and ceiling chandeliers. Before the summer sun sets at 9PM, senior citizens traipse about the district with unleashed, pure-bred dogs in tow, wearing carefully chosen, discrete shirts and shoes that whisper wealth more slyly than any scream.
