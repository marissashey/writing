            water dances.
            it surges into salt + foam to marry th=m
                creates freshwater daughter lake and loch
            it  s n a k e s  through  g r i t  and  s o i l  to hungry roots,
                glides down glasses forged from seaworn sand,
            and presses earthbound 'gain through faucet ducts.

            water drowns.
            a flood does not discriminate
                stops not for C)hild nor C)ritter
            the best, distressed, obsessed, and all the rest
                are just another in the scorning eyes of M)other.

# <ins> qianhai bay </ins>

            down a path of trees and beach umbrellas
            a man and a boy sell coconuts

            man stands at the tail end of a run-down truck
            the hatch, pulled down, is his chopping board
            man lifts knife up, up, up, and slashes down
            severing slabs of coconut shell and sliding a straw in

            boy, younger than my brother nine, parks wheelbarrow on the grass
            he wields an orange power drill
            and send husks splattering onto dirt and grass.

            boy is messy
            boy lines the street with shavings
            boy is the crowd favorite

            ''ni kan ta you duo e du--
            look how vicious he is!''

            the old man smiles toothily
            i line up at his truck
            i drain my drink in the shade of palms
            then line up again

            man severs the fruit's top
            and fashions spoon from shell
            i drift off, scooping meat to mouth,
            smiling, sunburnt, satisfied
