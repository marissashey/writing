   “小心!”--my mother darts out to grab my arm and a truck roars past.

   “I wasn’t going to walk, you know.” I was skimming the sidewalk, but on it just the same.
   
   Shenzhen's streets are littered with crumpled newspapers, fast food wrappers, and cigarette butts.
   
   Just as quickly as they are discarded, these articles of pedestrian life are flattened by jelly slippers, Nikes and their knockoff cousins, and motorbikes rattling on and off the sidewalks, swerving wildly to avoid even wilder taxi trucks/

   It is a Sunday in late July when my aunt suggested we get away from the cloying congestion of the city. The bay beckoned, I suppose, but also the wifi was down when it never was.

   My mother’s hand drops from my forearm only when we descend subway stairs and enter white-tiled underground. 
   
   Two uniformed men stand guard and watch us place our bags on the baggage scanner. They give the picnic basket a cursory glance but spend longer inspecting Dad’s work briefcase. Then, they wave us through the security check and further into the station. Dad produces four subway tokens that send us past the turnstiles and to the main train platform. Men and women in crisp work clothes part briskly around us, eyes glazed.

   “孩子们, do you know how to read the subway map?” Dad’s voice booms as he points to an overhead sign in the train car. Eyes flick off their phones and onto us. 

   “当然知道,” I say, in my best Mandarin. Dad reads each station name to us anyway. 

   An hour’s train ride whisks us from city grays to bay colors untranscribable. The subway entrance at Qianhai Bay is the only modern, machine-made construction here. Its straight and sharp-edged glass and metal jut out haggardly and offbeat. It's an abrupt departure from our feral surroundings. Winking wildflowers and dirt paths grow where they want to, unkempt, untamed, unyielding. 
   
   Back in Shenzhen, the skyscrapers yawn at dirt paths. They stretch and stand as quickly as Jenga blocks can tumble down. Back in Shenzhen, you may know a street today, but tomorrow a slew of stores and shopping centers will make grand openings, new people and new technologies will flood in, and the city will have outpaced you again. 

   But people laugh and shout freely, along the bay, faces lit and lacking shadows. My mother had promised only to 散步 on the nature trails, but now she rushes for the seawater, even though she scraped herself awfully once, rushing the same way. Later I watch her sift the sand barefoot, sandals dangling in hand. The crabs beckon for my brother to trap them. This is what he says, anyway. I wander off to explore the footpaths embedded with massaging stones. Dad takes a business call, hands waving about wildly. 

   Fishermen’s boats float close to shore, children dance back and forth across the docks, and women stroll in twos and threes between throes of trees. 

   Down a path shaded by trees and beach umbrellas, a man and boy compete for loose change in the pockets of passersby. The old man’s truck is parked parallel to the sidewalk and stockpiled with coconuts. Slowly and methodically, his knife hacks slabs of shell onto the road. A boy, younger than my brother nine, stations a wheelbarrow under a tree. A crowd gathers to watch him wield his power drill. His line is longer, but the old man’s truck is close enough to benefit from the attention. Families sip leisurely on their drinks in the shade of trees. When their coconuts are drained, they line up again. The vendors sever the fruit tops, fashioning spoons from shell. We drift off, scooping meat to mouth, smiling, sunburnt, satisfied.

  When we return to the city, my brother and I chuck supermarket coconuts onto the paved sidewalk. When the skulls crack and milk spills down the sides, we peel back the plastic wrap and dig in. Dad catches on quickly after coming home to coconut husks and plastic littered across the pavement, Mom tries to switch us over to Vita Coco, and, just like that, with the taste of wind and salt and coconut still on our tongues, we settle back into life in the city.
