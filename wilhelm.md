Charlottenburg is three and four-dollar-sign restaurants, luxury jewelry stores and bridal boutiques, and new, mostly uninhabited apartments furnished with Scandinavian style dining tables and ceiling chandeliers. Before the summer sun sets at 9PM, senior citizens traipse about the district with unleashed, pure-bred dogs in tow, wearing carefully chosen, discrete shirts and shoes that whisper wealth more slyly than any scream.
