   In West Berlinâ€™s Charlottenburg, people chase the ephemeral. Charlottenburg is three and four-dollar-sign restaurants, luxury jewelry stores, and bridal boutiques. She is new, mostly uninhabited apartments furnished with Scandinavian style dining tables and ceiling chandeliers. She is kempt trees, wine and cheese over groceries, and below average sushi. Around midday, old couples traipse about the district with pure-bred dogs running unleashed ahead. They wear discreet shirts and shoes that whisper wealth more slyly than any scream.
