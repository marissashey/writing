<ins> the wilhelm scream</ins>

   in West Berlinâ€™s Charlottenburg, people chase the ephemeral. <br>
   Charlottenburg is three and four-dollar-sign restaurants,  <br>
   luxury jewelry stores, and bridal boutiques.  <br>
    <br>
   she is new, mostly uninhabited apartments furnished in Scandinavian style;  <br>
   kempt trees, wine and cheese above groceries, and fifth-rate sushi.  <br>
   she is old people traipsing about, killing time,  <br>
   pure-bred dogs unleashed ahead, with 9pm bedtimes and discreet shirts and shoes  <br>
   that whisper wealth more loudly than any scream.  <br>
