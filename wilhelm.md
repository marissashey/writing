in West Berlinâ€™s Charlottenburg, people chase the ephemeral.
Charlottenburg is four and more-dollar-sign restaurants
luxury jewelry stores and bridal boutiques.
she is unlived apartments in Scandinavian style
kempt trees wine and cheese no groceries and fifth-rate sushi.
she is soft wrinkled hands spilling time,
pure-bred dogs unleashed ahead,
9pm bedtimes, pressed shirts, and shoes discreet
whispering wealth more loudly than any scream.
