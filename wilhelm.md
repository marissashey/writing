   In West Berlinâ€™s Charlottenburg, people chase the ephemeral. <br>
   Charlottenburg is three and four-dollar-sign restaurants,  <br>
   luxury jewelry stores, and bridal boutiques.  <br>
    <br>
   She is new, mostly uninhabited apartments furnished in Scandinavian style.  <br>
   She is kempt trees, wine and cheese above groceries, and fifth-rate sushi.  <br>
   She is old people traipsing about, killing time,  <br>
   with pure-bred dogs unleashed ahead, 9pm bedtimes, and discreet shirts and shoes  <br>
   whispering wealth more loudly than any scream.  <br>
