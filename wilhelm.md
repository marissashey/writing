   In West Berlinâ€™s Charlottenburg, people chase the ephemeral. Charlottenburg is three and four-dollar-sign restaurants, luxury jewelry stores, and bridal boutiques. She is new, mostly uninhabited apartments furnished Scandinavianly. She is kempt trees, wine and cheese over groceries, and fifth-rate sushi. Old people traipse about the district with pure-bred dogs unleashed ahead and discreet shirts and shoes whispering wealth more loudly than any scream.
