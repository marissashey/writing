<ins> kaiser wilhelm scream</ins>

in West Berlinâ€™s Charlottenburg<br>
people chase the ephemeral<br>
Charlottenburg is four and more-dollar-sign restaurants<br>
luxury jewelry stores and bridal boutiques<br>
she is unlived apartments in Scandinavian style<br>
kempt trees wine and cheese no groceries and fifth-rate sushi<br>
she is soft wrinkled hands spilling time<br>
pure-bred dogs unleashed ahead<br>
9pm bedtimes pressed shirts and shoes discreet<br>
whispering wealth more loudly than any scream<br>
