    water dances.
    it surges into salt and foam to marry them
        creates freshwater daughter lake and loch
    it  s n a k e s  through  g r i t  and  s o i l  to hungry roots,
        glides down glasses forged from seaworn sand,
    and presses earthbound 'gain through faucet ducts.

    water drowns.
    a flood does not discriminate
        stops not for child nor critter
    the best, distressed, obsessed, and all the rest
        are just another in the scorning eyes of mother

            down a path of trees and beach umbrellas
            a man and a boy sell coconuts

            man stands at the tail end of a run-down truck
            the hatch, pulled down, is his chopping board
            man lifts knife up, up, up, and slashes down
            severing slabs of coconut shell and sliding a straw in

            boy, younger than my brother nine, parks wheelbarrow on the grass
            he wields an orange power drill
            and send husks splattering onto dirt and grass.

            boy is messy
            boy lines the street with shavings
            boy is the crowd favorite

            "ni kan ta you duo e du--
            look how vicious he is!"

            the old man smiles toothily
            i line up at his truck
            i drain my drink in the shade of palms
            then line up again

            man severs the fruit's top
            and fashions spoon from shell
            i drift off, scooping meat to mouth,
            smiling, sunburnt, satisfied

|    “Xiaoxin! (Watch out!)” My mom darts out to grab my arm as I skim the curb of the sidewalk. A truck roars past.
|
|   “I wasn’t going to walk, you know.” The light turns green, and our family crosses as one. Shenzhen's streets are littered with crumpled newspapers, fast food wrappers, and cigarette butts. Just as quickly as they are discarded, these articles of pedestrian life are flattened by jelly slippers, Nike sneakers, polished loafers, and motorbikes rattling on and off the sidewalks, swerving wildly to avoid even wilder taxi drivers and trucks.
|
|   It is a Sunday in July when my parents, brother, and I agreed that we couldall do with some time from the cloying congestion of the city. The bay beckons. We decide to take the subway there.
|
|   My mother’s vice grip on my forearm doesn’t loosen until we descend the subway entrance and enter the white-tiled underground station, which, unlike the city above ground, is spotless. Two uniformed men stand guard and watch us place our bags on the baggage scanner. They give our picnic basket a cursory glance but spend longer inspecting Dad’s work briefcase. Then, they wave us through the security check and further into the station. Dad produces four subway tokens that send us past the turnstiles and to the main train platform. Men and women in crisp work clothes part briskly around us, eyes glazed.
|
|   “Haizimen, do you know how to read the subway map?” Dad’s voice booms as he points to an overhead sign in the train car. Eyes flick off their phones and onto us. 
|
|   “Dangran zhidaole,” I say, in my best Mandarin. Dad reads each station name to George and me anyway. 
|
|   An hour’s train ride whisks us from city grays to bay purples, blues, oranges, and greens. The subway entrance at Qianhai Bay is the only modern, machine-made construction for miles. Its straight and sharp-edged glass and metal jut out from the ground, offbeat. It is an abrupt departure from its feral surroundings, where warm-colored wildflowers and dirt paths grow where they want to. Even more so compared to where we came from, the bay is untamed. Back in Shenzhen, it seems like metal-toned skyscrapers crop up at ever-increasing speeds, and another building is assembled as quickly as a Jenga puzzle comes tumbling down. Back in Shenzhen, you may know a street today, but tomorrow a slews of stores and shopping centers will make grand openins, new people and new technologies will flood in, and the city will have outpaced you again.
|
|   People laugh and shout freely, here in Qianhai Bay, faces lit and lacking stern shadows. My mother, who said on the train she would do no more than sanbu on the nature trails, rushes for the steps leading directly to seawater, and sifts the sand with bare feet, sandals dangling in hand. The waves beckon for my brother to explore the docks and go crab fishing. I wander off toexplore the footpaths on my own, while Dad smiles warmly and takes a business call. 
|
|   Fishermen’s boats float close to shore, children dance back and forth across the docks, and women stroll in twos and threes between throes of trees. Later, Dad tells me that the only homes the families of the bay know are their shabby boats. I feel a pang of pity fused with envy.
|
|   Down a path shaded by trees and beach umbrellas, two vendors sell coconuts. An old man’s truck is parked parallel to the sidewalk, fully loaded with a hill of the fruit. Slowly and methodically, his knife hacks off slabs of shell until an opening is made. Then he slips a drinking straw in, and exchanges fruit for coin with the customer at the front of the line. A boy, younger than my brother nine, stations a wheelbarrow under a tree. A crowd gathers to watch him wield his power drill and send coconut husks splattering onto the streets. Those who do not want to wait in his line queue up at the old man’s truck. Business is good for them both. Families sip leisurely on their drinks in the shade of trees. When their coconuts are drained, they line up again. The man and the boy sever the top of the fruit and fashion a spoon out of the smallest piece of shell. Customers drift off, scooping coconut meat into their mouths, smiling, sunburnt, and satisfied.
|
|   For weeks, my brother and I chuck shaved, store-bought coconuts onto the paved sidewalk after our parents leave for work. When the skulls crack enough for milk to spill down the sides, we peel back the plastic wrap, slurp up the liquid inside, give the meat a quick rinse, and dig in. Dad catches on quickly after coming home to coconut husks and plastic littered across the pavement of our gated community, Mom tries to switch us over to Vita Coco, and, just like that, with the taste of wind and salt and coconut still on our tongues, we settle back into life in the city.




<ins> the wilhelm scream</ins>

|   In West Berlin’s Charlottenburg, people chase the ephemeral. Charlottenburg is three and four-dollar-sign restaurants, luxury jewelry stores and bridal boutiques, and new, mostly uninhabited apartments furnished with Scandinavian style dining tables and ceiling chandeliers. Before the summer sun sets at 9PM, senior citizens traipse about the district with unleashed, pure-bred dogs in tow, wearing carefully chosen, discrete shirts and shoes that whisper wealth more slyly than any scream.
